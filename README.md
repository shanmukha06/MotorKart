Motokart is an e-commerce website that deals with various automobiles like cars,bikes,trucks.
In this we have two interfaces one is Employee interface and customer interface.First we need to
set the path in the programm where our project file is located and change accordingly.We have databse
rought file.when we run the project first import the database to the work bench software and start 
importing the database.After importing database we run the project with the command "python manage.py runserver".
It gives the http link and when u click on it we just first go first for employee login by url/employee login/  .
First register to the employee login and these details save in the employee table which can present in the motokart schema.
After registering we can see details of employee end such as category,category interface,product ,product interface and we also add some interfaces about automobiles.
By seeing all the details we just logged out employee page and login with the crediantials which we login before.


By using the above the link we just go for the customer login by using by  url/customerhomepage/  .
First register the customer login and and provide the details accordingly.After login we get
